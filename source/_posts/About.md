I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. [Aswin Sankaranarayanan](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~saswin) and Prof. [Matthew O'toole](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motoole2/). My research interests mainly focus on **computational photography**, which jointly solves imaging problems with **computer vision** algorithms and **optical** designs.

My past publication includes near-eye **3D displays**, **neural rendering**, **imaging behind scattering media**, and **deep learning**-based domain adaptation, with a total of 2k citations.

**I am looking for a full-time position starting from January 2024.**
